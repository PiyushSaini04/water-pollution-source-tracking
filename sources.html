<br>

        <ul>
            <li><h2>Waterway Impairments</h2></li>
            <p>
            When pollutants enter our waterways, they become
            contaminated and, according to the Clean Water Act, have
            “impaired” water quality. Impairments restrict uses such as
            primary contact (swimming), secondary contact (boating), and
            fish and oyster production.<br>
            To clean the waterway, we have to address the pollution
            sources within the watershed (all of the land contributing
            pollution to the river and its tributaries).
            </p>
            <br>
            <li><h2>LPBF Pollution Source Tracking- The Watershed Approach</h2></li>
            <p>
            LPBF began water quality monitoring in 1994, upgrading the program in 2001. Based on results
            from our program, we began the watershed approach in 2002, piloting the program on the Bogue
            Falaya Watershed in St. Tammany Parish. So far, we have worked in the Bogue<br>
            Falaya/Abita/Tchefuncte Watershed (St. Tammany Parish), the Tangipahoa Watershed
            (Tangipahoa Parish), and the Tickfaw Watershed (Tangipahoa,
            St. Helena, and Livingston Parishes).
            Our approach has been multidisciplinary

                <li> Water Quality Monitoring</li>
                <li> On the ground source tracking</li>
                <li> GIS and mapping of everything</li>
                <li> Education at all levels</li>
                <li> “Partners”- Coordination with agencies</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><h2>Monitoring Water Quality</h2></li>
            <ul>
                <li>First Step- We monitor the main river and all major tributaries.</li>
                <li>Understanding the water quality throughout the watershed- along</li>
            the main stem of the river and contributions of each tributary.
                <li>Gives first indication of where the pollution is entering the system</li>
                <li>Allows us to approach agencies and interested parties with factsin-hand. (Make the issue worth their time, energy, money)</li>
                <li>In time, allows us to track progress.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            We find that it is important to invest in professional monitoring with
            quality assurance. Volunteer monitoring is not viewed to be of the same
            high standard and may be disregarded. Also, monitoring must be
            performed on a regular basis for months to years to track progress.
            </p>
            <br>
            <li><h2>Tracking Sources</h2></li>
            <p>
            LPBF uses a step-wise process to track pollution sources:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Big point sources (large direct discharge pipes),</li>
                <li>Small point sources (small direct discharge pipes),</li>
                <li>Non-point sources (contaminants flow over land).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            We track point sources first because they are easiest to find and
            are likely contributing much of the problem in urban setting.

            <ul>
                <li>For waterways impaired for fecal coliform and/or dissolved
            oxygen, this is imperative.</li>
                <li>We perform on the ground door-to-door inspections and
            assistance</li>
                <li>Research on LDEQ’s EMDS (Electronic Document
            Management System) website to locate information on
            permitted commercial facilities.</li>
                <li>However, facility may not be permitted. Historic disconnect
            between LDHH and LDEQ.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><h2>GIS/ Mapping</h2></li>
            <ul>
            <li>Excellent tool to visually synthesize data</li>
            <li>Shows potential sources in relation to each other and
            waterways</li>
            <li>GPS units inexpensive- some under $100.</li>
            <li>Good free tools- Google Map- on LPBF website,</li>

            <br>
            <li><h2>Education</h2></li>
            <p>
            LPBF performs education at any and all levels, from the general
            public, to school children, to voters, to decision-makers.<br>

            <h1><u>Data analysis</u></h1> <br>
            <h2>Weather Data</h2>
            <p>
            Daily mean temperature and daily precipitation data during 2011–2023 were obtained from PRISM time-series 
            datasets, which are available online1. Daily climate data provided by the PRIMS climate group have a spatial 
            resolution of 4 km. The methods for generating the climate data were described previously. Four weather variables 
            were created, including daily mean temperature on the sampling date , daily mean temperature on the day before 
            sampling , daily precipitation on the sampling date , and daily precipitation on the day before sampling .<br>
            <img class="map hover" src="mapping.png" alt="map">
            </p><br><br>
            <h2>Hydrologic Data</h2>
            <p>

            The hydrologic information in the study area was obtained from National Hydrologic Dataset (NHD) plus version 2 
            (NHDplus V2) .Developed by United States EPA and United States Geological Survey, NHDplus V2 consists of three 
            major components: NHD, National Elevation Dataset (NED), and Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The drainage network 
            information including rivers, streams and ponds in the study area was provided by the NHD. From the WBD, a six-level
            hydrologic unit (the smallest classification unit of watershed) was obtained.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
            <p>
            After these data were collected and processed, exploratory data analysis was conducted to examine the mean, 
            standard deviation, and range of weather and land cover data as well as microbial source tracking data obtained 
            for the all sampling sites. The relationships between microbial sources (the probabilities of specific microbial sources),
            weather, and land cover variables (the percentages of land use types) were examined by Spearman correlation analysis.<br>

            <h2>Update</h2>
            <p>
            State-of-the-Science: Fecal Source Identification and Associated Risk Assessment Tools is a workshop that was conducted in November 2012 at Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) to summarize and encourage audience discussion about the state of knowledge regarding the following questions:
            <ul>
            <li>How accurate are present techniques for determining whether the fecal signature at a beach is human or non-human in origin?</li>
            <li>What are the relative health risks between human and non-human fecal sources?</li>
            <li>What is the level of scientific uncertainty when using this information in a management context?</li>
            </ul>

            There are links to the workshop presentations at SCCWRP's website.
